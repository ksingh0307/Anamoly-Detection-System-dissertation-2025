# üí≥ Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning (Autoencoder) approaches. It is part of a university dissertation aiming to improve the reliability and adaptability of fraud detection systems.


## üìò Project Overview

With the exponential growth of digital transactions, fraud detection has become increasingly critical. Traditional rule-based methods are often rigid and ineffective against evolving fraud patterns. This project explores how deep learning, particularly Autoencoders, can detect anomalies in financial datasets by learning the normal behavior and flagging deviations.


## üß† Models Used

The notebook evaluates the performance of the following models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Deep Autoencoder (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)


## üìÇ Files Included

- `Anamoly-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the code for data loading, exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.


## üìä Features Covered

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Handling class imbalance
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of various ML models for fraud detection
- Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep autoencoder
- Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix


## üì• Dataset Used
